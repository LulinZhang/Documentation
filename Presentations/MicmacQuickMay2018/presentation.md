#Introduction
###Introduction

MicMac is a free open-source (Cecill-B licence) photogrammetric suite that can be used in a variety of 3D reconstruction scenarios.

In aims mainly at professionnal or academic users but constant efforts are made to make it more accessible to the general public.

###Introduction

Its main strengths are :

  * high degree of versatility
  * metrological aspect of reconstruction
  * adapted for big datasets
  * simplified tools
  * education-oriented
  * many users
  * free and open source

#Community

###Sources
MicMac is developped by Marc Pierrot Deseilligny since 2003.

It is open source since 2007 (Cecill-B licence).

The main repository is \url{https://github.com/micmacIGN/micmac} since 
2016.

It is developped in C++, with optional graphical user interfaces in Qt.


###Documentation

MicMac is mainly used via command-line tools.
Some of them are very complex and versatile, but they have a simplified 
version for non-expert users.
