#Introduction
###Introduction

MicMac is a free open-source (Cecill-B licence) photogrammetric suite that can be used in a variety of 3D reconstruction scenarios. In aims mainly at professionnal or academic users but constant efforts are made to make it more accessible to the general public.

Its main strengths are :

  * high degree of versatility
  * metrological aspect of the reconstruction
  * adapted for big datasets
  * simplified tools
  * open for education
  * users community
  * free and open source

  \includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{images/col2} \quad \pause
  \includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{images/col3} \quad \pause
$\Rightarrow$
  \includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{images/col_tie} \pause

###Sources
MicMac is developped by Marc Pierrot Deseilligny since 2003.

It is open source since 2007 (Cecill-B licence).

The main repository is \url{https://github.com/micmacIGN/micmac} since 
2016.

It is developped in C++, with optional interfaces in Qt.


###Documentation

MicMac is mainly used via command-line tools.
Some of them are very complex and versatile, but they have a simplified 
version for non-expert users.
